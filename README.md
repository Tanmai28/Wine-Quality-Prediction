# 🍷 Wine-Quality-Prediction
Predict wine quality before the first sip. Machine learning models decode chemical signatures to forecast flavor and finesse.


AI-powered prediction of wine quality using physicochemical data — turning molecules into metrics and grape chemistry into insight.

## 🚀 Overview

This project uses machine learning models to predict wine quality from measurable chemical properties. Built in Python using popular libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

## 🔬 Dataset

- Origin: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Type: Red wine physicochemical and quality ratings
- Features: pH, alcohol, sulphates, citric acid, etc.
- Target: Quality score (0–10 scale)

## 🧠 Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine  
- Gradient Boosting  
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix

## 📊 Insights

- Alcohol and volatile acidity are strong predictors
- Ensemble models outperformed single estimators
- Visualizations reveal key quality patterns in data

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
